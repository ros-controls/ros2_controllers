interface_names: |
  (optional) Defines custom, per axis interface names.
  This is used if different prefixes, i.e., sensor name, or non-standard interface names are used.
  It is sufficient that only one ``interface_name`` is defined.
  This enables the broadcaster to use force sensing cells with less than six measuring axes.
  An example definition is:

  .. code-block:: yaml

     interface_names:
       force:
         x: example_name/example_interface
