constraints:
    Default values for tolerances if no explicit values are set in the ``JointTrajectory`` message.

gains: |
  The parameters are used to configure PID loops for the ``velocity`` or ``effort``-only command interfaces. This structure contains the controller gains for every joint with following the control laws

  * If ``velocity`` is the only command interface:

    .. math::

      u = k_{ff} v_d + k_p e + k_i \sum e dt + k_d (v_d - v)

    with the desired velocity :math:`v_d`, the measured velocity :math:`v`, the position error :math:`e` (definition see below),
    the controller period :math:`dt`, and the ``velocity`` manipulated variable (control variable) :math:`u`, respectively.

  * If ``effort`` is the only command interface:

    .. math::

      u = k_{ff} v_d + \delta_d + k_p e + k_i \sum e dt + k_d (v_d - v)

    with the desired velocity :math:`v_d`, the desired effort :math:`\delta_d` if provided in the trajectory (or 0 otherwise), the measured velocity :math:`v`, the position error :math:`e` (definition see below),
    the controller period :math:`dt`, and the ``effort`` manipulated variable (control variable) :math:`u`, respectively.

  If the joint is of continuous type, the position error :math:`e = normalize(s_d - s)` is normalized between :math:`-\pi, \pi`,
  i.e., the shortest rotation to the target position is the desired motion.
  Otherwise  :math:`e = s_d - s` is used, with the desired position :math:`s_d` and the measured
  position :math:`s` from the state interface.

  If you want to turn off the PIDs (open loop control), set the feedback gains to zero and an appropriate value for feed-forward gain :math:`k_{ff}`.
