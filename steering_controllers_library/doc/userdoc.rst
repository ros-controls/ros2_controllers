Library with shared functionalities for mobile robot controllers with steering drives, with so-called non-holonomic constraints.

The library implements generic odometry and update methods and defines the main interfaces.

The update methods only use inverse kinematics, it does not implement any feedback control loops like path-tracking controllers etc.

Car-Like robots basics and nomenclature
--------------------------------------------------------------

The forward integration of the kinematic model using the encoders of the wheel actuators â€” is referred to as **odometric localization** or **passive localization** or **dead reckoning**. We will call it just **odometry**.

Unicycle Model
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To define the coordinate systems, consider the following simple unicycle model

.. image:: images/unicycle.svg
   :width: 550
   :align: center
   :alt: Unicycle

* :math:`x_b,y_b` is the body-frame coordinate system of the robot, located in the center of the rear axle.
* :math:`x_w,y_w` is the world coordinate system
* :math:`x,y` are the cartesian coordinates of the robot in world coordinates, i.e., the contact point of the rear wheel on the ground
* :math:`\Theta` is the heading angle of the robot, i.e. the orientation of the robot's :math:`x_b`-axis w.r.t. the world's :math:`x_w`-axis

In the following, we want to command the robot with a desired body twist

.. math::

  \vec{\nu}_b = \left[ \begin{array}{l}
                      \vec{\omega}_{b} \\
                      \vec{v}_{b} \\
                      \end{array}\right],

where :math:`\vec{v}_{b}` is the linear velocity of the robot in its body-frame, and :math:`\omega_{b,z}` is the angular velocity of the robot in its body-frame. As we consider steering robots on a flat surface, it is sufficient to give

* :math:`v_{b,x}`, i.e. the linear velocity of the robot in :math:`x_b`-axis direction
* :math:`\omega_{b,z}`, i.e. the angular velocity of the robot around :math:`x_z`-axis

as desired system inputs. We will formulate the inverse kinematics to calculated desired commands to the robot from the given body twist.

Bicycle Model
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The following picture shows a car-like robot with two wheels, where the front wheel is steerable. This model is also known as the bicycle model.

.. image:: images/car_like_robot.svg
   :width: 550
   :align: center
   :alt: Car-like robot

* :math:`\phi` is the steering angle of the front wheel
* :math:`v_{rear}, v_{front}` is the velocity of the rear and front wheel
* :math:`l` is the wheelbase

We assume that the wheels are rolling without slipping. This means that the velocity of the contact point of the wheel with the ground is zero and the wheel's velocity points in the direction perpendicular to the wheel's axis. The **Instantaneous Center of Rotation** (ICR), i.e. the center of the circle around which the robot rotates, is located at the intersection of the lines that are perpendicular to the wheels' axes and go through the contact points of the wheels with the ground.

As a consequence of the no-slip condition, the velocity of the two wheels have to fulfill the following constraint:

.. math::
  v_{rear} = v_{front} \cos(\phi)

**Forward Kinematics**

We have to distinguish between two cases: Rear wheel drive and front wheel drive.


For the rear wheel drive, the velocity of the rear wheel is the input of the system.

.. math::

  \dot{x} &= v_{rear} \cos(\Theta) \\
  \dot{y} &= v_{rear} \sin(\Theta) \\
  \dot{\Theta} &= \frac{v_{rear}}{l} \tan(\phi)


For the front wheel drive, the velocity of the front wheel is the input of the system.

.. math::

  \dot{x} &= v_{front} \cos(\Theta) cos(\phi)\\
  \dot{y} &= v_{front} \sin(\Theta) cos(\phi)\\
  \dot{\Theta} &= \frac{\sin(\phi)}{l}


**Inverse Kinematics**

For the rear wheel drive:

.. math::

  \phi &= \arctan\left(\frac{l w_{b,z}}{v_{b,x}} \right)\\
  v_{rear} &= v_{b,x}


For the front wheel drive:

.. math::

  \phi &= \arctan\left(\frac{l w_{b,z}}{v_{b,x}} \right)\\
  v_{front} &= \frac{v_{b,x}}{\cos(\phi)}

**Odometry**

We can directly use the forward kinematics to calculate the odometry.

Double Traction Axis
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The following picture shows a car-like robot with three wheels, where there are two traction wheels at the rear.

.. image:: images/double_traction.svg
   :width: 550
   :align: center
   :alt: A car-like robot with two traction wheels at the rear

* :math:`w_r` is the wheel track of the rear axle

**Forward Kinematics**

The forward kinematics is similar to the bicycle rear-wheel drive but with :math:`v_{b,x}`

.. math::

  \dot{x} &= v_{b,x} \cos(\Theta) \\
  \dot{y} &= v_{b,x} \sin(\Theta) \\
  \dot{\Theta} &= \frac{v_{b,x}}{l} \tan(\phi)


**Inverse Kinematics**

The turning radius of the robot is

.. math::

  R_b = \frac{l}{\tan(\phi)}

Then the rear wheels' velocity have to fulfil these conditions to avoid slipping

.. math::

  v_{rear,left} &= v_{b,x}\frac{R_b - w_r/2}{R_b}\\
  v_{rear,right} &= v_{b,x}\frac{R_b + w_r/2}{R_b}

**Odometry**

The calculation of :math:`v_{b,x}` from two encoder measurements of the traction is overdetermined.
If there is no slip and the encoders are ideal,

.. math::

   v_{b,x} = v_{rear,left} \frac{R_b}{R_b - w_r/2} =  v_{rear,right} \frac{R_b}{R_b + w_r/2}

holds. In case of measurement errors, we take the average of both to get a more robust solution, yielding

.. math::

   v_{b,x} = \frac{v_{rear,left}+v_{rear,right}}{2}


Execution logic of the controller
----------------------------------

The controller uses velocity input, i.e., stamped `twist messages <twist_msg_>`_ where linear ``x`` and angular ``z`` components are used.
Values in other components are ignored.

In the chain mode the controller provides two reference interfaces, one for linear velocity and one for steering angle position.
Other relevant features are:

* support for front and rear steering configurations;
* odometry publishing as Odometry and TF message;
* input command timeout based on a parameter.

The command for the wheels are calculated using ``odometry`` library where based on concrete kinematics traction and steering commands are calculated.
