joint_state_controller
----------------------

The ``joint_state_controller`` has been renamed to ``joint_state_broadcaster``
in order to differentiate between true controllers and simple data broadcasters.

This package will be removed in ROS H-Turtle. Instead, use package
``joint_state_broadcaster``.

Documentation for ``joint_state_broadcaster`` can be found `here <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/blob/master/joint_state_broadcaster/doc/userdoc.rst>`_.
