Release Notes: Iron to Jazzy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This list summarizes the changes between Iron (previous) and Jazzy (current) releases.

admittance_controller
************************
* Remove ``robot_description`` parameter from parameter YAML, because it is not used at all (`#963 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/963>`_).

diff_drive_controller
*****************************
* The twist message on ``~/cmd_vel`` is now required to be of stamped type (`#812 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/812>`_).
* Remove unused parameter ``wheels_per_side`` (`#958 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/958>`_).

joint_trajectory_controller
*****************************

* Parameter ``allow_nonzero_velocity_at_trajectory_end`` is now per default ``false`` (`#834 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/834>`_).
* Activate update of dynamic parameters (`#761 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/761>`_ and `#849 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/849>`_).
* The parameter ``start_with_holding`` is removed, it now always holds the position at activation (`#839 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/839>`_).
* Continue with last trajectory-point on success, instead of hold-position from current state (`#842 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/842>`_).
* Add console output for tolerance checks (`#932 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/932>`_):

  .. code::

    [tolerances]: State tolerances failed for joint 2:
    [tolerances]: Position Error: 0.020046, Position Tolerance: 0.010000
    [trajectory_controllers]: Aborted due goal_time_tolerance exceeding by 1.010000 seconds

* Goals are now cancelled in ``on_deactivate`` transition (`#962 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/962>`_).
* Empty trajectory messages are discarded (`#902 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/902>`_).
* Action field ``error_string`` is now filled with meaningful strings (`#887 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/887>`_).
* Angle wraparound behavior (continuous joints) was added from the current state to the first segment of the incoming trajectory (`#796 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/796>`_).
* The URDF is now parsed for continuous joints and angle wraparound is automatically activated now (`#949 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/949>`_). ``angle_wraparound`` parameter was completely removed.
* Tolerances sent with the action goal are now processed and used for the action. (`#716 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/716>`_). For details, see the `JointTolerance message <https://github.com/ros-controls/control_msgs/blob/master/control_msgs/msg/JointTolerance.msg>`_:

  .. code-block:: markdown

    The tolerances specify the amount the position, velocity, and
    accelerations can vary from the setpoints.  For example, in the case
    of trajectory control, when the actual position varies beyond
    (desired position + position tolerance), the trajectory goal may
    abort.

    There are two special values for tolerances:
     * 0 - The tolerance is unspecified and will remain at whatever the default is
     * -1 - The tolerance is "erased".  If there was a default, the joint will be
            allowed to move without restriction.

pid_controller
************************
* ðŸš€ The PID controller was added ðŸŽ‰ (`#434 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/434>`_).

steering_controllers_library
********************************
* Changing default int values to double in steering controller's yaml file. The controllers should now initialize successfully without specifying these parameters (`#927 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/927>`_).
* A fix for Ackermann steering odometry was added (`#921 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/921>`_).
* Do not reset the steering wheels to ``0.0`` on timeout (`#1289 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/1289>`_).

tricycle_controller
************************
* tricycle_controller now uses generate_parameter_library (`#957 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/957>`_).
