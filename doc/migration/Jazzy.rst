Iron to Jazzy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This list summarizes important changes between Iron (previous) and Jazzy (current) releases, where changes to user code might be necessary.


diff_drive_controller
*****************************
* The twist message on ``~/cmd_vel`` is now required to be of stamped type (`#812 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/812>`_).

joint_trajectory_controller
*****************************

* Parameter ``allow_nonzero_velocity_at_trajectory_end`` is now per default ``false`` (`#834 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/834>`_).
* The parameter ``start_with_holding`` is removed, it now always holds the position at activation (`#839 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/839>`_).
* Goals are now cancelled in ``on_deactivate`` transition (`#962 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/962>`_).
* Empty trajectory messages are discarded (`#902 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/902>`_).
* Angle wraparound behavior (continuous joints) was added from the current state to the first segment of the incoming trajectory (`#796 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/796>`_).
* The URDF is now parsed for continuous joints and angle wraparound is automatically activated now (`#949 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/949>`_). Remove the ``angle_wraparound`` parameter from the configuration and set continuous joint type in the URDF of the respective joint.
