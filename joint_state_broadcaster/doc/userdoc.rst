joint_state_broadcaster
=======================

The broadcaster reads all state interfaces and reports them on ``/joint_states`` and ``/dynamic_joint_states``.

Commands
--------

Broadcasters are not real controllers, and therefore take no commands.

Hardware interface type
-----------------------

By default, all available *joint state interfaces* are used, unless configured otherwise.
In the latter case, resulting interfaces is defined by a "matrix" of interfaces defined by the cross-product of the ``joints`` and ``interfaces`` parameters.
If some requested interfaces are missing, the controller will print a warning about that, but work for other interfaces.
If none of the requested interface are not defined, the controller returns error on activation.

Published topics
----------------

* ``/joint_states`` (``sensor_msgs/msg/JointState``):

  Publishes *movement-related* interfaces only — ``position``, ``velocity``,
  and ``effort`` — for joints that provide them. If a joint does not expose a given
  movement interface, that field is omitted/left empty for that joint in the message.

* ``/dynamic_joint_states`` (``control_msgs/msg/DynamicJointState``):

  Publishes **all available state interfaces** for each joint. This includes the
  movement interfaces (position/velocity/effort) *and* any additional or custom
  interfaces provided by the hardware (e.g., temperature, voltage, torque sensor
  readings, calibration flags).

  The message maps ``joint_names`` to per-joint interface name lists and values.
  Example payload::

    joint_names: [joint1, joint2]
    interface_values:
      - interface_names: [position, velocity, effort]
        values: [1.5708, 0.0, 0.20]
      - interface_names: [position, temperature]
        values: [0.7854, 42.1]

  Use this topic if you need *every* reported interface, not just movement.

.. note::

   If ``use_local_topics`` is set to ``true``, both topics are published in the
   controller’s namespace (e.g., ``/my_state_broadcaster/joint_states`` and
   ``/my_state_broadcaster/dynamic_joint_states``). If ``false`` (default),
   they are published at the root (e.g., ``/joint_states``).


Parameters
----------
This controller uses the `generate_parameter_library <https://github.com/PickNikRobotics/generate_parameter_library>`_ to handle its parameters. The parameter `definition file located in the src folder <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/blob/{REPOS_FILE_BRANCH}/joint_state_broadcaster/src/joint_state_broadcaster_parameters.yaml>`_ contains descriptions for all the parameters used by the controller.

Order of the joints in the message
----------------------------------

The order of the joints in the message can determined by 3 different parameter settings:

1. No defined ``joints`` parameter and ``use_urdf_to_filter`` set to ``false``:
    The order of the joints in the message is the same as the order of the joints' state interfaces registered in the resource manager. This is typically the order in which the hardware components are loaded and configured.

2. No defined ``joints`` parameter and ``use_urdf_to_filter`` set to ``true``:
    The order of the joints in the message is the same as the order of the joints in the URDF file, which is inherited from the loaded URDF model and independent of the order in the `ros2_control` tag.

3. Defined ``joints`` parameter along with ``interfaces`` parameter:
    The order of the joints in the message is the same as the order of the joints in the ``joints`` parameter.

    If the ``joints`` parameter is a subset of the total available joints in the URDF (or) the total available state interfaces, then only the joints in the ``joints`` parameter are published in the message.

    If any of the combinations of the defined ``joints`` parameter and ``interfaces`` parameter are not in the available state interfaces, the controller will fail to activate.

.. note::
    If the ``extra_joints`` parameter is set, the joints in the ``extra_joints`` parameter are appended to the end of the joint names in the message.
